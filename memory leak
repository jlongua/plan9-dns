With encrypted-dns v0.9.6 and debian 11 was experiencing a severe memory leak.
Memory was being consumed in 3-4 hours and oom kicked in.

With encrypted-dns v0.9.6 and debian 10 there was no memory leak...

For now I have downgraded encrypted-dns to v0.3.23 and appears stable.

Most of the updates to encrypted-dns were dependency updates, except for
v0.9.5 that was for fixing - The server would previously stop accepting connections if the system ran out of file descriptors.
